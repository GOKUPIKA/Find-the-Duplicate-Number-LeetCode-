// **FIND THE DUPLICATE NUMBER**

Given an array of integers nums containing n+1 integers where each integers is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

There is only one repeated number in nums, return that repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only constant extra space.

EXAMPLE 1:
INPUT: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
OUTPUT: 2

EXAMPLE 2:
INPUT: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
OUTPUT: 3

EXAMPLE 3:
INPUT: nums = [1,1]
OUTPUT: 1

EXAMPLE 4:
INPUT: nums = [1,1,2]
OUTPUT: 1

CONSTRAINTS:

* 1 <= n <= 105
* nums.length == n + 1
* 1 <= nums[i] <= n
* All the integers in nums appear only once except for precisely one integer which appears two or more times.
